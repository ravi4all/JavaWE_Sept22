Binary Tree

- binary tree cannot have more than 2 children
- it can have 0,1 or 2 child

- Used in machine learning known as decision tree
- Expression evaluation
    3 + ((5+9) * 2)

- tree is a collection of nodes
- node contains 3 things
    - left child
    - data
    - right child

- Tree CRUD

Tree Traversal
- Breadth First / Level Order - traverse tree level by level
- Depth First   - complete first side then other other side
    - InOrder   - LPR - Left Parent Right
    - PreOrder  - PLR - Parent Left Right
    - PostOrder - LRP - Left Right Parent
